# lighthouse-server

Inspired by [`@lhci/server`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/main/docs/server.md), this server compatible with [`@lhci/cli@0.12.x`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) to save historical Lighthouse data, displays trends in a dashboard, and offers comparison between builds.

## Deployment

- Create database and deploy collections based on [appwrite.json](../../appwrite.json)

- Deploy appwrite function and set environment variables
